# Building my portfolio with Hugo and GitHub Pages

Welcome to my first post! In this post, I’ll be sharing my journey of building my **Hugo portfolio**, a fast and optimized website powered by **GitHub Pages**. Using **Hugo** allows me to create a streamlined and efficient static site, perfect for showcasing my web development projects. You’ll find information about my work in **web development**, **generative AI**, and how I integrated **ChatGPT** into my workflow.

## Why I Chose Hugo and GitHub Pages

Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator. By deploying with GitHub Pages, I can easily host my portfolio for free. I’ll also be using tools like ChatGPT to streamline content creation and enhance my site.
